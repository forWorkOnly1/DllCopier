I started a technical training at Linedata that includes several lessons on .net/c# ( fundamentals / UI aspects: WPF framework, XAML language and MVVM architecture, WCF framework, Multi-threading and parallel programming and SQL training ). Then I worked on a mini project that involves both C# and SQL. For the rest of the time I tried to resolve one of the problems the team was facing. The team have an issue with building 3 seperate solutions in 3 seperate git repos. there is a solution which is called shared, because it contains dlls shared between the client and the server(2 other solutions). the shared dlls are used as nuget packages in the client and server, so if they make a change in the shared and want to test it locally, they simply can't do that, therefore, they need to merge the code to the git repo first the test it. to resolve this issue, I tried to create a console app in c# that takes the shared dlls and copy them in the local folder so we can test locally before the merge.
